MVP
- A small business owner can log on and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices. 
- They can also make listing for what they want to sell, which will show up to all users.  
- They add a new item by selecting their market location, and then typing in their item name, description, and price. 

Stretch
- Business owners can upload their picture to their profile
